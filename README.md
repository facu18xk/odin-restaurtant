## Restaurant Website Project

This repository contains a simple restaurant website built with webpack and designed to showcase dynamic content and tabbed browsing.
Project Structure

    src: Contains the JavaScript modules for the project.
        index.js: Entry point for the application, includes the initial page-load function.
        Other modules for each tab ("Home," "Menu," "Contact"), exporting functions to create and style content for each tab.

    dist: Contains the bundled output files.
        index.html: HTML skeleton with header, navigation, and a content div.
        main.js: Bundled JavaScript file generated by webpack.


### JavaScript Modules

    src/index.js: Entry point that initializes the initial page-load function.
    Each tab has its own module (home.js, menu.js, contact.js), exporting a function to create, style, and append content to the div#content.

### Tab Switching Logic

The index.js file contains the tab-switching logic. Event listeners for each button in the header navbar clear the current content of div#content and execute the appropriate tab module to populate it with new content.
